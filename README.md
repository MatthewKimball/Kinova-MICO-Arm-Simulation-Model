Kinova-MICO-Arm-Simulation-Model
============================

## Overview 

The ``Kinova-MICO-Arm-Simulation-Model`` module provides a ROS simulation interface for Kinova's MICO robot arm. Simulation models of the arm allow users to develop code within the RVIZ and Gazebo environments before implementing code on the real arm. A MOVEIT! compatible model can used to plan and execute desired path motions.
